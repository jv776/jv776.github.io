                Another puzzle game for Android made with Unity. A bunch of points are hidden on a plane, and your goal is to draw lines that
                split the plane into separate regions such that each one contains exactly one point. Each region shows the number of points
                hidden inside it, giving just enough information for players to estimate the approximate location of each point and solve the
                puzzle.
            </p>

            <p>
                Making this game involved dealing with a couple of interesting algorithmic problems. The first of these was creating the data
                structure to represent the intersecting lines and how they split the plane. The second was writing code to find every valid
                solution to a puzzle. At some point I would like to write about my approaches to each of these problems, but for now my focus
                is on completing the game itself.

                A simple puzzle game for Android phones made with Unity. Plays sort of like an inverted version of Minesweeper,
                where you try to use hints to find hidden objects rather than avoid them.
